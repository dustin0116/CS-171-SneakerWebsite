    <p>Sneakers are shoes, or items of footwear. They're something that's easily
      overlooked by people. People may view it as just</br>
      a simple piece of everyday wear, but sneakers mean so much more. Sneakers
      are important because it's a tool to help us </br>
      walk outside and also play different sports and exercises. Professional
      atheletes are very particular when it comes to sneakers,</br>as specific
      models and the technology affect how they perform.
