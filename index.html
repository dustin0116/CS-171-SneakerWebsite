    <p>Sneakers are shoes, or items of footwear. They're something that's easily
      overlooked by people. People may view it as just
      a simple piece of everyday wear, but sneakers mean so much more. Sneakers
      are important because it's a tool to help us
      walk outside and also play different sports and exercises. Professional
      atheletes are very particular when it comes to sneakers, as specific
      models and the technology affect how they perform.
