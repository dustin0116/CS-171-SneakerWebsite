      <p>Sneakers are shoes, or items of footwear. They're something that's easily
        overlooked by people. People may view it as just
        a simple piece of everyday wear, but sneakers mean so much more. Sneakers
        are important because it's a tool to help us
        walk outside and also play different sports and exercises. Professional
        atheletes are very particular when it comes to sneakers, as specific
        models and the technology affect how they perform.
