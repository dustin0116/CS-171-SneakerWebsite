    <h2 class="h">Brand Overview</h2>
    <img class="imgsize" src="../images/subimages/jordanshoes.jpg" alt="Jordan Shoes Overview">
    <p>
      With the success of Michael Jordan and him being an athelete under the
      Nike brand, his line of basketball sneakers became immensely popular in
      the basketball world. Eventually, the success and popularity formed
      Jordan shoes and apparel into its own brand as a subsidary of Nike.
      Even though older Jordan sneaker models have older technology and aren't
      worn much for basketball games, people still wear them to this day as
      lifestyle sneakers.

    <h3 class="sub">Flightspeed</h3>

    <p>
      Jordan Brand's Flightspeed technology is an enhancement of Nike's most
      used Air Zoom technology. As a cushion inside sneakers, Flightspeed allows
      weight to be spread out evenly and allows the energy of impact to return,
      making the sneaker-wearer to have more bounce and power.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub">FastFit</h3>
    <img class="imgsize" src="../images/subimages/jordanfastfit.jpg" alt="Jordan FastFit">
    <p>
      The FastFit technology is a mechanism that allows performance sneakers to
      work without laces and is the first of its kind in sneaker history. A tab
      on the sneaker's tongue can be pulled and the sneaker will instantly tighten
      up around the wearer's foot.
