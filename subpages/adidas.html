      Usually seen as the second largest sneaker brand in the world behind Nike,
      Adidas is valued at around $16.7 billion. Although the brand started off
      being well known for its tennis sneakers, Adidas also evolved into a top brand
      in creating sneakers for other sports such as basketball and soccer. Adidas
      is also incredibly popular in pop culture due to its collaborations with
      music artists such as Kanye West.

      A revolutionary sneaker cushioning innovation. Adidas' BOOST technology is
      a lightweight foam that can be compressed when under pressure and bounce back to its

    <p>
      The 4D technology by Adidas is a midsole that is created solely by 3D
      printing. This technology allows a midsole to be created around an athelete's
      specific needs. Simple programming with 4D can create a midsole that balances
      the cushioning and stability for a specific sport.
