    <h2 class="h">Notable Technologies</h2>
    <h3 class="sub">Nike Air</h3>

    <p>
      Developed by former NASA engineer M. Frank Rudy, Nike Air is a special
      cushion technology for sneakers. It is a bubble-like midsole with air
      inside. The name comes from Nike's marketing strategy idea where people running
      or walking on "air" would provide great cushioning, since the air inside
      the bubble-like midsole won't wear out after repeated use. The air
      cushioning also provides more bounciness, making it ideal for atheletes.

    <h3 class="sub">Flyknit</h3>

    <p>
      Focusing on the concepts of lightness, breathability, and support, Nike's
      Flyknit technology is essentially a one-piece knitted upper instead of
      the traditional sturdy, fixed and multi-piece upper in sneakers. Flyknit
      is flexible and lighter due to the lightweight yarns that are used. While
      the various different types of knit patterns throughout makes it possible
      for some areas of Flyknit shoes have tighter weaves for more support.

    <h3 class="sub">Adapt</h3>

    <p>
      In 2016, Nike revealed the world's first smart self-lacing sneaker called
      Nike HyperAdapt 1.0. Based off their own concept of self-lacing sneakers
      Marty McFly first showcased and wore in <i>Back to the Future Part II</i>,
      Nike made this technology a reality and called it Nike Adapt. With small
      electric motors in the laces, the motors start to tighten the laces as
      soon as a person is steps into the sneakers, which the sneaker senses by
      weight. This technology is a huge step towards making lives easier for people
      with disabilites, since they can now put on sneakers without any difficulties.
