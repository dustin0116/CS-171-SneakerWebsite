    <h3 class="sub">Nike Air</h3>

    <p>
      Developed by former NASA engineer M. Frank Rudy, Nike Air is a special
      cushion technology for sneakers. It is a bubble-like midsole that has air
      inside. The name comes from their marketing strategy where people running
      or walking on "air" would provide great cushioning, since the air inside
      the bubble-like midsole itself won't wear out in the long term of use.
      The air cushioning also provides more bounciness, making it great for running.

    <h3 class="sub">Flyknit</h3>

    <p>
      Focusing on the concepts of lightness, breathability, and supportive, Nike's
      Flyknit technology is essentially a knitted upper instead of the traditional
      sturdy and fixed form upper in sneakers. Flyknit is flexible and lighter.
